************************************
Raspberry PI Most Stupid Kernel Ever 
************************************

A simple kernel from scratch is something that I've always wanted to do.
This not pretend to be something big but big enough to undertand how a lot of stuff really works.
Because I have a Raspberry Pi model B this is the target platform.

= HOW TO COMPILE =

You need to install arm crosscompiler arm-none-eabi-gcc package to be able to compile the sources.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/absolute_path_to/rpi-mske/toolchain/toolchain-arm-none-eabi-rpi.cmake ..
$ make

Binary kernel.img file should be created.

= HOW TO DEPLOY IN THE TARGET =

Generated kernel.img is the image you have to use as your kernel image.

Create a sdcard with a fat partition and add files included in boot directory.
Add kernel.img in the partition too.

Boot your pi connected with ftdi cable to gpio and use minicom or other terminal program to view boot process.

Enjoy!
